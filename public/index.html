      content="Full Stack Developer,with experience working in NodeJS, React, Redux, and SQL among other technologies in the industry. I started my professional career as a sound engineer and through it I discovered my interest in programming, using programming languages like JUCE/C++ and MATLAB for digital signal processing. At the end of my undergraduate, I decided that I wanted to strengthen my skills as a programmer focusing on web development, that is how I entered the Henry bootcamp where I enhanced my theoretical and practical knowledge and got my title as Full Stack Web Developer. I excel in continuous learning, and creative thinking, with strong interpersonal skills, and as a proactive being."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
